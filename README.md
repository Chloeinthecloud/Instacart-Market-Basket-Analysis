# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis
Instacart is an American technology company, which was founded in 2012. It operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick-up service in US and Canada.
Customers could shop for groceries through Instacart App or Instacart.com from various retailer partners. The order is shopped and delivered by the Instacart Shoppers.

Here are the objectives of the project:

* Analyze the anonymized data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users open sourced by Instacart
* Find out hidden association between products for better cross-selling and upselling
* Perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing and anticipate customer behavior
* Build a Machine Learning Model to perdict which previously purchased product will be in user's next order
